# Stuck in what?

As a kid, I was often told, "It's a big world out there!" and "You can't deal with what is out there!" and the likes. I learnt from my peers that they were warned about similar things.

A majority of human population take huge pleasure in hiding in comfort zones, showing their prowess only on their home turf, sulking away at the slightest chance of challenge and restraining the rest of their kind to the same measures. Eventually, they accept it as _way of life_ and pass that _wisdom_ on to future generations.

A tiny portion of these people manage to break out of this cocoon. If you are one of the members of the set, you would get to interact with people of other geographical locations and face other cultural and political scenarios. This may be through studies or work, but you get to know that the worldview you had in your infancy may not be the only one out there. There are varying degree of responses you may have in such a situation, but one of the common feeling is of getting overwhelmed.

All those childhood teachings get back at you. You feel the vastness of the world, the depth of responsibilities and the sense of smallness inside you keeps growing. Weird, that! The feeling that _grows_ is of you feeling _small_. That sure means a lot of emptiness in there. It's like a large room, that keeps on getting larger and larger and the sole occupant of that room is a pea. Consider that pea to be your self-esteem at this point.

It is at this point that you start thinking that you should know more about the world; about its past, about its present and about what may come ahead. There is a little problem. You want to know _what_ is out there. _What_ is it that you are not aware of yet. That sense of unknown tears at you.

You see, at this point all you care about is facts. While it is great to know them, (I do know quite a few facts myself, like wizards in Middle Earth used to measure distance by bird-power) facts are not raw knowledge. They are _simplified_, processed, compressed, bit-sized and served-on-the-plate form of knowledge.
