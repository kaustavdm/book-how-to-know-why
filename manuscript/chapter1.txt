# Asking Why?

Ever wondered why asking a simple "*Why*" in certain situations can drastically change them?

Consider this: *You are sitting at a coffee shop with a close friend of yours. You have known each other for a long time and share a lot of things with each other. Suddenly your friend moves a bit uneasily, clears throat, looks into your eyes and, almost forcefully, says,* "I think I am in love with you."

*Among all the possible answers that may choke up your throat at that point, you blurt out*, "Why?"

*Awkward silence follows...*

You see, the human brain is one of the best thinking machines out there. So far, the smartest of human-made computers have not managed to scale to the power of a single human brain. They may soon get there. But till they get there, the humans can bask in the glory of owning the most sophisticated computer ever built, housed inside their cranium.

But the humans are inherently lazy. Garfield the cat would not have been so popular otherwise. Among all the things that they may do at a certain point, they somehow try to choose to do nothing at all. They procrastinate. Or worse, they forget that they had procrastinated.

This means, they usually make very little use of their brain. They usually follow instructions, the same way as a computer would execute the commands in software code. They don't question enough.

Even when they question, they ask "how" can they achieve the purpose of the instructions they have been provided.

While the strongest computers are fighting to get processing powers equal or more than the human brain, the humans are trying their best to lower their computing powers to the level of an old Commodore 64. Speaking more clearly: the amount of brain power that an average human uses, given the processing powers they have, can be equated to running only word processor programs on the latest and highest-specification Macbook.

**But why anyone with so much power would want to waste it?**

If you are not a human, this may seem absurd. If you are a human, you may already know the answer. Or you may not.

For the sake of the rest of our conversation let us assume that you are a human, even if you are not one.

So, for a human, it seems to be really difficult to put forward a question. If you (remember you are a human by now) have not been used to questioning things, you would not probably even question the title of this chapter.

The title of the book may have seemed like it is going to be a crazy-serious discussion on the psychology of human brain, and how you may be able to cope with the difficulties in your life - either as married, working, living or dead. The title of this chapter may have gripped your interest. But the beginning could have made you think, "*Wait a minute! This is not what I signed up for!*".

You could have wondered, "*Why did this guy start writing such a serious thing in such a weird way?*"

If you have questioned so far, you are probably already in the smaller group of humans who think. If you have not questioned and have just casually read on this far, then there are three possibilities:

a. You are looking for something to read while you are whiling away your time somewhere,
b. You are looking for help in dealing with the regular troubles of your life, hoping that an inspirational book will give you hints, or,
c. You, simply, do not think.

If you belong to either of these three cases, remember that you do also have a brain and you can use it to think clearly and think ahead. If you did not use it, that simply leaves us with one option: You did not *want* to use it.

The average humans usually do not learn to use their brain efficiently, blame the education system if you want, but that is the fact. This initially leads to under-utilization of the brain, till they reach a point when think that they are incapable of using their brains.

**What's the point?**

The usual trouble with self-help books is that they tell you what to do when you have some sort of trouble. It is almost like a doctor prescribing a medicine after you have caught cold. The best way to get over common cold is to prevent it. So, the best way of handling the issues which may lead you to look for self-help books, is to stop those issues from cropping up at the first place. The way out is to know _why_ they happen.

If you could prevent yourself from catching common cold by knowing why common colds occur, you can very well stop visiting a doctor for curing the cold.

You need to know the root of all the stuff you deal with. But, no one will provide you with all the answers, neatly served on a plate. You will need to question; but question wisely.

This brings me to the point of telling you what this book is _not_:

- This is not a book which will give you a quick tip on solving the deepest mysteries of life,
- This will not get you a girlfriend or boyfriend,
- This will not grow your hair.

But, if you read on, this book will be an exploration in the realm of curiosity. By the end of it, you would begin to question everything; distinguish causes from effects and try to understand the causes themselves.

A few by-products of this may be increase in self-confidence, improvement in analytical thinking or realizing that the deepest mysteries of life are mysteries simply because they are unexplored.

So far, so good? Let us begin!
